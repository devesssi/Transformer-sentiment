1.Why only encoder?
For sentiment analysis, you’re doing sequence-to-label, not sequence-to-sequence.

Input: text sequence

Output: single label (positive/negative)

You don’t need to generate sequences (like in translation, where decoder is required).
Encoder alone can learn a representation of the input sequence and you attach a classifier head on top of it.
That’s why in models like BERT, only the encoder is used.

If you wanted to build:

machine translation → you’d need both encoder + decoder.

text summarization → encoder + decoder (if generative).

question answering → encoder is often enough (depends).


🔷 Why only encoder?
A Transformer has two main parts in the original paper:

Encoder stack

Decoder stack

Encoder:
Takes an input sequence and computes a contextualized representation of the whole sequence.
For each token, it learns a vector that contains information about that token and its relationship to all others.

Decoder:
Takes the encoder’s output and generates an output sequence, one token at a time.
Used in tasks where the output is a sequence, and it needs to depend on what has already been generated (e.g., translation, summarization).\

Multi-Head Attention → Attention(x)
   ↓
Residual: x + Attention(x)

LayerNorm
   ↓
Feed Forward → FFN(x)
   ↓
Residual: x + FFN(x)
   ↓
LayerNorm



❓ Why put embedding.py under models/?
🔧 1. It’s part of the model, not the data pipeline
nn.Embedding + positional encoding are learnable parameters of the model.

These are applied inside the forward pass of your transformer.

Therefore, they are model components, not data transformations.

🧠 Think of it this way:
If something has trainable weights and runs during model(input), it belongs in models/.

If something happens before batching (like tokenization or padding), it belongs in data/ or utils/.

So:

text
Copy
Edit
[Tokenizer] → [Pad] → [Tensor: token IDs] → 
[Embedding + Positional Encoding (models/embedding.py)] → 
[Attention, Layers, Output (models/...)]
🧱 Why not data/?
If you put embeddings in data/, you’re mixing data preprocessing with learnable logic.

Bad separation = hard to debug, extend, or reuse.

🔁 Real example: HuggingFace Transformers
Even they follow this logic:

bash

🎯 What is nn.Embedding?
It’s a lookup table that maps discrete token IDs (integers) to dense vectors (embeddings).

Think of it as a trainable dictionary:
token_id → vector representation

✅ Signature
python
Copy
Edit
nn.Embedding(
    num_embeddings,  # total number of tokens in your vocab
    embedding_dim    # dimensionality of the vector for each token
)
🧠 What do the inputs mean?
1. num_embeddings → your vocab size
This is the total number of unique tokens you allow.

For example:

Vocab: ["<pad>", "<unk>", "I", "love", "NLP"]

num_embeddings = 5

Each token gets an index from 0 to 4, and nn.Embedding(5, embedding_dim) stores 5 learnable vectors.

2. embedding_dim → vector size for each token
This is how “deep” the representation for each word will be. Typical values:

128 (lightweight)

256 / 512 (standard)

768 (BERT)

1024 (big)

Each token ID will be mapped to a vector of shape [embedding_dim].

🧪 Example
python
Copy
Edit
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

embed = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=10_000, embedding_dim=512)

input = torch.tensor([[1, 3, 5], [4, 2, 9]])  # [batch=2, seq_len=3]
output = embed(input)  # shape: [2, 3, 512]
What’s happening:

Input: [1, 3, 5] → 3 token IDs

Output: those token IDs are replaced with their 512-dim learned vectors

📦 What nn.Embedding contains internally
It’s basically just:

python
Copy
Edit
self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_embeddings, embedding_dim))
Every time you pass in token IDs, it does:

python
Copy
Edit
vectors = self.weight[input_ids]
And yes — these weights are trainable via backpropagation.

🔥 Why not one-hot + Linear?
Good question. One-hot encoding → Linear would technically work:

python
Copy
Edit
one_hot: [batch, vocab_size]
linear: [vocab_size, d_model]
But:

It’s inefficient (most of the vector is zero)

nn.Embedding is faster, cleaner, and learns better since it's just a matrix lookup

It's what every SOTA transformer model uses internally

🧠 So in short:
Concept	Meaning
nn.Embedding(V, D)	Creates a lookup table with V tokens and D-dimensional vectors
Input	Integer tensor of token IDs: [batch, seq_len]
Output	Embedded tensor: [batch, seq_len, embedding_dim]
Trainable?	Yes, it's optimized during training
