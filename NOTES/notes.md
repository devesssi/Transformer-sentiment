1.Why only encoder?
For sentiment analysis, you’re doing sequence-to-label, not sequence-to-sequence.

Input: text sequence

//DIMENSIONALITY OF MODEL = DIM OF IP EMBEDDING

Output: single label (positive/negative)

You don’t need to generate sequences (like in translation, where decoder is required).
Encoder alone can learn a representation of the input sequence and you attach a classifier head on top of it.
That’s why in models like BERT, only the encoder is used.

If you wanted to build:

machine translation → you’d need both encoder + decoder.

text summarization → encoder + decoder (if generative).

question answering → encoder is often enough (depends).


🔷 Why only encoder?
A Transformer has two main parts in the original paper:

Encoder stack

Decoder stack

Encoder:
Takes an input sequence and computes a contextualized representation of the whole sequence.
For each token, it learns a vector that contains information about that token and its relationship to all others.

Decoder:
Takes the encoder’s output and generates an output sequence, one token at a time.
Used in tasks where the output is a sequence, and it needs to depend on what has already been generated (e.g., translation, summarization).\

❓ Why put embedding.py under models/?
🔧 1. It’s part of the model, not the data pipeline
nn.Embedding + positional encoding are learnable parameters of the model.

These are applied inside the forward pass of your transformer.

Therefore, they are model components, not data transformations.

🧠 Think of it this way:
If something has trainable weights and runs during model(input), it belongs in models/.

If something happens before batching (like tokenization or padding), it belongs in data/ or utils/.

So:

text
Copy
Edit
[Tokenizer] → [Pad] → [Tensor: token IDs] → 
[Embedding + Positional Encoding (models/embedding.py)] → 
[Attention, Layers, Output (models/...)]
🧱 Why not data/?
If you put embeddings in data/, you’re mixing data preprocessing with learnable logic.

Bad separation = hard to debug, extend, or reuse.

🔁 Real example: HuggingFace Transformers
Even they follow this logic:

bash
Copy
Edit

🎯 What is nn.Embedding?
It’s a lookup table that maps discrete token IDs (integers) to dense vectors (embeddings).

Think of it as a trainable dictionary:
token_id → vector representation

✅ Signature
python
Copy
Edit
nn.Embedding(
    num_embeddings,  # total number of tokens in your vocab
    embedding_dim    # dimensionality of the vector for each token
)
🧠 What do the inputs mean?
1. num_embeddings → your vocab size
This is the total number of unique tokens you allow.

For example:

Vocab: ["<pad>", "<unk>", "I", "love", "NLP"]

num_embeddings = 5

Each token gets an index from 0 to 4, and nn.Embedding(5, embedding_dim) stores 5 learnable vectors.

2. embedding_dim → vector size for each token
This is how “deep” the representation for each word will be. Typical values:

128 (lightweight)

256 / 512 (standard)

768 (BERT)

1024 (big)

Each token ID will be mapped to a vector of shape [embedding_dim].

🧪 Example
python
Copy
Edit
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

embed = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=10_000, embedding_dim=512)

input = torch.tensor([[1, 3, 5], [4, 2, 9]])  # [batch=2, seq_len=3]
output = embed(input)  # shape: [2, 3, 512]
What’s happening:

Input: [1, 3, 5] → 3 token IDs

Output: those token IDs are replaced with their 512-dim learned vectors

📦 What nn.Embedding contains internally
It’s basically just:

python
Copy
Edit
self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_embeddings, embedding_dim))
Every time you pass in token IDs, it does:

python
Copy
Edit
vectors = self.weight[input_ids]
And yes — these weights are trainable via backpropagation.

🔥 Why not one-hot + Linear?
Good question. One-hot encoding → Linear would technically work:

python
Copy
Edit
one_hot: [batch, vocab_size]
linear: [vocab_size, d_model]
But:

It’s inefficient (most of the vector is zero)

nn.Embedding is faster, cleaner, and learns better since it's just a matrix lookup

It's what every SOTA transformer model uses internally

🧠 So in short:
Concept	Meaning
nn.Embedding(V, D)	Creates a lookup table with V tokens and D-dimensional vectors
Input	Integer tensor of token IDs: [batch, seq_len]
Output	Embedded tensor: [batch, seq_len, embedding_dim]
Trainable?	Yes, it's optimized during training



Great — this code defines **Positional Encoding** as introduced in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper. It's a core part of the Transformer architecture and is used to inject **order information** into the input token embeddings, since the Transformer itself has no recurrence or convolution to capture sequence order.

Let’s break it down **line by line**, deeply and clearly:

---

### 🔁 `import` Statements

```python
import torch
import math
```

* `torch`: For defining tensors and neural network layers.
* `math`: For mathematical functions like `log`, used in the encoding formula.

---

### 📦 `class PositionalEncoding(torch.nn.Module):`

You’re creating a custom **PyTorch layer/module**. It inherits from `torch.nn.Module`, so it can be used as part of a `nn.Sequential` or any neural network model.

---

### 🧠 `__init__(self, d_model, max_len=5000):`

* `d_model`: Dimension of the model (i.e., embedding size, like 512 or 768).
* `max_len`: Max number of tokens in a sequence this module can handle (default: 5000).
* You're **precomputing** the positional encodings for all possible positions up to `max_len`.

---

### 🏗️ Step 1: Initialize Empty PE Matrix

```python
pe = torch.zeros(max_len, d_model)  # Shape: [max_len, d_model]
```

* `pe[i][j]` will contain the positional encoding for position `i` and dimension `j`.
* Final shape: `[max_len, d_model]` — one vector per position.

---

### 🧱 Step 2: Compute Positional Index

```python
position = torch.arange(0, max_len, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1)  # Shape: [max_len, 1]
```

* Generates a column vector:

  ```
  [ [0],
    [1],
    [2],
    ...
    [max_len-1] ]
  ```
* This represents **token positions** in the sequence.
* Shape: `[max_len, 1]`

---

### 🧮 Step 3: Compute Frequency Divider

```python
div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2).float() * (-math.log(10000.0) / d_model))
```

* This gives us:

  $$
  \text{div\_term}[i] = 10000^{-2i / d\_model}
  $$

* Why every `2` steps? Because:

  * Even indices get `sin`, odd indices get `cos`.
  * `d_model = 512` → 256 `sin` components, 256 `cos`.

* Shape: `[d_model // 2]` (only for even dims)

---

### 🌊 Step 4: Fill Sine and Cosine Components

```python
pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)
```

* `0::2` = even dimensions → apply `sin`.
* `1::2` = odd dimensions → apply `cos`.

#### Why sine & cosine?

To inject **unique, continuous, smooth** positional signals.
Any relative distance between tokens can be derived from a **linear combination** of these encodings due to their wave properties.

So final `pe[i]` = `[sin(pos/f1), cos(pos/f1), sin(pos/f2), cos(pos/f2), ...]`

---

### 📐 Step 5: Add Batch Dimension

```python
pe = pe.unsqueeze(0)  # Shape: [1, max_len, d_model]
```

* Adds a dummy batch dimension.
* So when you later add it to a tensor of shape `[batch_size, seq_len, d_model]`, it broadcasts correctly.

---

### 💾 Register as Buffer

```python
self.register_buffer('pe', pe)
```

* Makes `pe` a persistent part of the model (saved during `state_dict()`), but:

  * **Not a learnable parameter.**
  * Won’t be updated via backprop.
  * Useful for constants like this.

---

## 🔄 Forward Pass

```python
def forward(self, x):
    x = x + self.pe[:, :x.size(1), :]
    return x
```

### Input:

* `x`: Shape `[batch_size, seq_len, d_model]`
* It represents the embedded token vectors.

### What happens:

* Adds the corresponding positional encoding vector to each token embedding (position-wise).
* `self.pe[:, :x.size(1), :]` → slices only as many positions as the sequence length.
* Broadcasting ensures:

  * `[1, seq_len, d_model]` gets added to `[batch_size, seq_len, d_model]`.

---

### 🧠 Summary: Why this matters

Transformers have **no recurrence** and **no convolution**, so they don’t inherently understand order. This positional encoding is **the only signal** for token order, making it absolutely critical for sequence understanding.

---

Let me know if you want me to:

* Visualize these encodings.
* Show an example with a dummy input.
* Derive the math behind the frequency term more deeply.
* Compare with **learned positional encodings**.

Here’s a full note-style breakdown covering:

## ✅ Transformers Core Concepts: Deep Notes

---

### 🔸1. **Attention Mechanism** (Scaled Dot-Product)

**Goal**: Let the model "attend" to relevant tokens in the input sequence.

#### Steps:

1. Input tensor → linearly projected into:

   * **Query** (`Q`)
   * **Key** (`K`)
   * **Value** (`V`)

2. Compute scores:

   $$
   \text{scores} = \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}
   $$

   * $d_k$ = dimension of the key
   * The division stabilizes gradients (scaling).

3. Apply Softmax:

   * Converts raw scores to probability distribution.

   $$
   \text{Attention} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
   $$

---

### 🔸2. **Multi-Head Attention**

Instead of doing one big attention operation, **multiple smaller attention heads** are used in parallel.

**Reason**:

* Each head focuses on different parts of the input.
* Helps learn richer representations.

#### Steps:

* Split input into `num_heads`
* Each head computes attention in smaller subspaces
* Final result:

  $$
  \text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O
  $$

  * $W^O$: final linear projection weight

---

### 🔸3. **FeedForward Network (FNN)**

After attention, transformer applies a two-layer **fully connected** network:

```python
FNN(x) = max(0, xW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂
```

* `max(0, ...)` is **ReLU**
* This is **position-wise** → applies the same MLP to each token separately
* Adds non-linearity & capacity to the model

---

### 🔸4. **Positional Encoding**

Transformers are **order agnostic**, so we inject **position info**.

#### Formula:

$$
PE(pos, 2i) = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)
$$

$$
PE(pos, 2i+1) = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)
$$

> Injects periodic patterns (like waves) to help model understand token order.

#### Code Breakdown:

```python
pe = torch.zeros(max_len, d_model)  # init
position = torch.arange(0, max_len).unsqueeze(1)  # positions
div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2) * -(math.log(10000.0) / d_model))
pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)
```

* `div_term`: controls the frequency of sin/cos waves
* Alternating sin/cos helps separate even/odd dimensions

---

### 🔸5. **Layer Normalization**

**Why?** Normalize activations to stabilize training (like batchnorm but per-token).

#### What it does:

$$
\text{LayerNorm}(x) = \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} \cdot \gamma + \beta
$$

* Applies to **each token vector** across features
* Ensures mean=0, std=1 for each token

---

### 🔸6. **PyTorch Specific Concepts**

#### `view()`

* Reshapes tensor **without copying data**
* `x.view(batch, seq_len, dim)` → safe if layout is contiguous
* Similar to `reshape()` but stricter on memory layout

#### `unsqueeze(dim)`

* Adds a new dimension.
* `x.unsqueeze(0)` → from \[max\_len, d\_model] → \[1, max\_len, d\_model]
* Used for broadcasting (same PE across batches)

#### `register_buffer(name, tensor)`

* Adds tensor to model without making it a learnable param.
* Used for storing `pe` in `PositionalEncoding`

#### `.size(dim)` vs `.shape`

* `.size(dim)` = length of that dimension
* `.shape` = tuple of all dimensions

---

### 🔸7. **ReLU Activation**

* `ReLU(x) = max(0, x)`
* Introduces **non-linearity**
* Zeros out negative values → model focuses on "strong" positive activations
* Helps FNN capture complex patterns

---

### 🔸8. **Shape Tracking in Transformer**

For input `x` of shape `[batch, seq_len, d_model]`:

* Positional Encoding must be `[1, max_len, d_model]`
* LayerNorm works along `d_model` dimension
* Attention uses `Q, K, V` shaped as `[batch, heads, seq_len, dim_per_head]`

---

Let me know if you want diagrams, equations, or note export (PDF/Markdown). Want me to now break down the full attention module in PyTorch?


Sure! Here's a clear and concise explanation of **backpropagation (BP)**:

### 🔁 What is Backpropagation?

**Backpropagation** is the core algorithm used to train neural networks. It efficiently computes the **gradients** of the loss function with respect to each parameter (like weights and biases) in the network. These gradients tell us how to adjust the parameters to reduce the error.

---

### 🧠 How Does It Work? (Step by Step)

1. **Forward Pass**
   - Input data is passed through the network layer by layer.
   - Each layer applies:  
     `output = activation(weight × input + bias)`
   - The final output is compared to the true label using a **loss function** (e.g., mean squared error or cross-entropy).
   - This gives a **loss value**—a measure of how wrong the prediction is.

2. **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)**
   - Using the chain rule from calculus, the algorithm computes:
     > How much each parameter contributed to the final loss.
   - It starts from the output layer and moves backward through the layers.
   - For each parameter, it calculates:
     `∂(loss) / ∂(weight)` — the gradient.

3. **Parameter Update**
   - Once gradients are computed, parameters are updated to reduce the loss:
     ```
     weight = weight - learning_rate × gradient
     ```
   - This is typically done using an optimizer like **SGD** or **Adam**.

---

### 🔄 Why Is It Efficient?

Without backpropagation, you’d have to manually compute how each weight affects the loss—extremely slow for large networks.  
Backpropagation uses the **chain rule** and dynamic programming to compute all gradients in just **one forward and one backward pass**.

---

### 📌 Example (Simplified)

Suppose a tiny network:  
Input → Weight `w` → Output → Loss

- Forward: `output = input × w`, then `loss = (output - target)²`
- Backward:  
  `∂loss/∂w = ∂loss/∂output × ∂output/∂w`  
  `= 2(output - target) × input`

Now you know how to update `w` to make the prediction better.

---

### ✅ In the "Attention Is All You Need" Paper

- The **Transformer** uses backpropagation exactly like this.
- Even though attention is dynamic (it computes weights on the fly), it's **differentiable**, so gradients can flow through it.
- All learned parameters (in attention matrices, feed-forward layers, embeddings) are updated via backpropagation.

---

### 🧩 Summary

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1️⃣ Forward Pass | Compute predictions and loss |
| 2️⃣ Backward Pass | Compute gradients using chain rule |
| 3️⃣ Update | Adjust weights to reduce loss |

🔁 This process repeats for many batches of data, gradually improving the model.
